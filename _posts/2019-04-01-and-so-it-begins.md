Today begins my 90-day commitment to daily publishing. People adopt this practice to build their blogs. That is not my primary goal. I do hope the too-meager content I share will blossom. I do hope to finish the book faster and improve the quality of my talks at upcoming events. My primary goal though, is to get _tf_ out from under the weight of my own resistance.

A psychological cement slab presses down on my daily work, damning up the flow of shared ideas, insights, or whatever I'm trying to create. I work from behind it, from under it. Every day I tremble and push up on the weight. Some days, I avoid it by Being Busy, putting my fingers in my ears "la lalala lala". I negotiate with myself. I bribe. I delude. I apply willpower, succeed! Then I can't sustain my achievement because the reality is, I can't move that damn weight.

The slab has built up over time. Perfectionism mixes in. Almost everyone, I suspect, struggles with this. The weight of the world pushing back on you, one comment at a time. Women who think independently absolutely know what I'm talking about. You can't push back forever, its exhausting.

So I've created a new strategy -- raise my inner water level. Fill my  wellspring with strongly-supported daily publishing until that concrete slab rises up and floats away. Or becomes underwater art, a sunken wreckage. I can dive down and visit it when I'm feeling historical.

I have three rules: publish every day for 90 days, a minimum of 250 words, include a photo. I eat 250 words for breakfast.

Publishing on a single digital space would be counterproductive - I don't have a well-crafted blog post or a professional article ready to share every day. I can write a book review though, or a movie or restaurant or product review. I can create a short video. Craft a serious argument about an important issue or tell a funny story. Publish a system model and share how I made it. Post a recipe or a step-by-step description of how I stumbled through a project like building garden beds or sewing my first dress. Lists, oh, I love publishing lists. Maybe I'll publish a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/samsykesswears/status/890751932779839488) that gets [made into a movie](https://www.tor.com/2018/09/14/chuck-wendig-sam-sykes-viral-horror-twitter-you-might-be-the-killer-trailer/). I can write a song. I've never written a song but I could try it!
