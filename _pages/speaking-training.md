As part of my tech life, I enjoy speaking, writing and developing learning experiences. (After all, I was an actor and trainer before I learned to code.) I especially like making complex issues contextually relatable for people new to the subject. My current focus is [strategic thinking and enterprise system architecture](https://architecting-enterprise.com), but speaking remains my first love.

Here are some past trainings and [talks](#talks).  [Also, some examples of feedback.](#feedback) <a href="#feedback">Test</a>

## Training

In partnership with OSTraining, an entire Introduction to PHP programming course from variables to storing data in the database.

* [Course overview (subscription required)](https://www.ostraining.com/class/php/)

### PHP for NonProgrammers

This is a friendly programming introduction for people new to coding. The course takes a “Physics for Poets” approach to basic PHP concepts like variables, if/else statements, Boolean logic, functions, and hooks. Participants write code, read code, and have a clear understanding of how to continue practicing.

## Talks <a name="talks"></a>

### PHP for NonProgrammers

This is a friendly programming introduction for people new to coding. We’ll take a “Physics for Poets” approach to basic PHP concepts like variables, if/else statements, and functions. You’ll write some code, speak some geek, and start down the addictive path of programming logic. There’s also a geek quiz – in case you don’t know your Picards from your Kirks.

We’ll cover:

-   Variables ($variable = where I store my stuff)
-   Boolean logic (you can either eat cake OR eat cookies but you must run AND lift weights)
-   Conditional statements (if this is true, do that, else, do something else)
-   Functions (aka little blocks of “do stuff”)
-   Scope (sometimes I whisper, sometimes I shout)
-   Other tasty tidbits if time permits

This has been offered multiple times. A few examples:

### Mad Skillz: Become the Best in the World

Are you a themer or developer who wants to work on bigger, more complicated projects? Do you want to send your resume to top Drupal shops and get hired? Do you want to assess and approve your skills?

If so, come to this session and create your plan. You will leave with you a take-home list of essential traitz and skillz. You’ll also find out what a few top Drupal shops and in-house Drupal team leaders say are the “Most Important Skillz” their best developers possess.

We’ll focus on three essential questions:

1.  What specific skillz do I need to build?
2.  What kinds of experience should I seek to demonstrate those skillz?
3.  What are the essential non-tech skills that matter most?

Team builders and Drupal business or project owners will benefit too. You’ll get a master list of skills to use for team development plans, hiring assessments, and ideas for how to assess that “certain something” that the best developers possess.

### Building a Dynamic Team

In this Do it with Drupal presentation, Diana Dupuis looks at building a great team. A Drupal website is as effective, performant, and reliable as the team who builds it. Whether you need one developer or twenty, finding the right people is essential to a site’s success. What are the traits and skills to look for when hiring a Drupal developer? What can we learn from Drupal shops with years of experience building successful, and sometimes unsuccessful, Drupal development teams?

Once you find the right people, successful projects require a creative, ongoing blending of talent into a focused, productive team who, like a flock of birds, can adapt to course changes with grace. How can you encourage technical team leads to work with project managers, business owners, and stakeholders in ways that encourage and support the team’s dynamic problem-solving process? How do you turn expertise into successful Drupal products? We’ll consider these questions and answer a few of yours.

### Drupal for NonGeeks

Note: This is currently being developed into a longer form.

If you will never write a line of PHP code but need to understand how Drupal works, this session is for you. We’ll focus on a high-level, conceptual understanding of the Drupal framework. The goal of this session is to enable nonGeeks to make decisions about applying Drupal to their real world challenges and talk to developers (in their language).

Bring your questions. We’ll discuss the primary nonGeek roles related to Drupal and find out how this session can help you.

Topics:

-   What is a CMS?
-   What is Drupal, isn’t it a CMS?
-   Core, modules, themes — how do they go together.
-   Why do I care what a “hook” is?
-   Why are some hard things easy and some easy things hard (aka, expensive)?

And a few basics:

-   What is a node (content) and how can it be expanded?
-   What are blocks and their common usage?
-   What are Views and why does almost every site use them?
-   How are connections between different kinds of content created?
-   How are more complex pages (with varying kinds of content) created?

[DrupalCamp Stanford](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007034450/http://drupalcamp.stanford.edu/sessions/drupal-nongeeks&sa=D&ust=1543339874064000)

### Big Websites

Drupal powers many small-to-medium websites, from personal blogs to company intranets. Drupal also powers big sites like The Economist and The White House. How are the big sites different from the small ones? What are the main issues to consider when adopting Drupal for the enterprise? What skillset do developers need to build them?

We’ll talk about how big sites handle:

-   Workflow, version control, development environments
-   Quality control
-   Admin tasks
-   Performance and scalability
-   Project management and team building
-   For developers: what you need on your resume

This is an overview, suitable for geeks and non-geeks alike.

This session has been offered multiple times. Here’s [a video from Southwest Drupal Summit](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007034450/http://vimeo.com/20182312&sa=D&ust=1543339874066000). Note: I had a broken foot.

### Teaching Drupal

You know how to use Drupal. You know how to write code, build a theme, and SEO a site. But do you know how to teach others to use Drupal? For every site we create there are clients who must use it, many don’t know a node from a block. After this session, you will be able to introduce clients to Drupal without freaking them out.

We’ll cover:

-   Defining “need to know” and emphasizing main concepts
-   Thinking like a user, talking like a mentor
-   Using normal words with a sprinkling of Drupalese
-   Breaking down tasks keeping each user’s personality and background in mind
-   Translating “my site’s broken” into a useful and respectful response
-   How to think like a non-geek (for a few minutes)

This has been offered multiple times. Here’s the first and my favorite: [DrupalCon Cophenhagen](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007034450/http://cph2010.drupal.org/sessions/teaching-drupal.html&sa=D&ust=1543339874068000).

### Intro to Drush

(outdated)

When I was introduced to drush, a command line shell and scripting interface for Drupal, I thought, “meh, I can do those tasks already in about the same time with no learning curve.” Now? “Omg omg, do you use drush? You gotta try drush! It’s awesome!”

Find out why drush has transformed me into a groupie. In this session, we’ll walk through installing a Drupal site using drush, enabling modules, and common tasks like running update hooks, cron, and clearing the cache.

Intimidated by the command line? We’ll cover the basics and show you how development tools like Coda enable you to use drush inside a visual environment.

### The Economist (Tech Talk)

The Economist.com website is powered by Drupal and is currently being developed by three collocated teams – London, New York, and Austin.

In this presentation, the Austin team will describe the innovative solutions, daily workflow, performance challenges, necessary customizations, testing scheme, and third-party vendor integration that delivers The Economist Online to millions of users. The overview will be followed by a Q&A. Though this session will have a tech focus, we welcome questions from business-side attendees considering Drupal for the enterprise.

Given with Rob Ristroph and Aaron Forsander at [Dallas Drupal Days](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007034450/http://dallasdrupal.org/sessions/economist-tech-talk&sa=D&ust=1543339874070000) and with most of the Econ team at [DrupalCon London](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007034450/http://london2011.drupal.org/conference/sessions/economist-informal-technical-case-study&sa=D&ust=1543339874071000).

### Wikimedia Foundation (Tech Talk)

Tomasz couldn’t make it because of the volcano, so I gave this alone

After online contributions to the Wikimedia Foundation have been processed, $7.5 million during the last fundraiser alone, contact and contribution data is passed to CiviCRM. It is the “fundraiser backend” for managing hundreds of thousands of contributor records and includes some interesting customizations. Diana Montalion Dupuis (Four Kitchens) and Tomasz Finc (Wikimedia) will talk about how it works, the ongoing challenges, and prove that if Wikimedia can do it, so can you.

### CiviCRM for Drupal

CiviCRM is an open source, web-based, constituent relationship management application. Predominantly used by advocacy and non-profit groups, Civi can track contact data, enable memberships and donations, organize constituent groups, manage events, and make communication more effective.

Although there is a standalone version, Civi is more commonly integrated into a Drupal (or Joomla) CMS installation. Like Drupal itself, it can be an empowering tool for groups with a mission. It can also be a challenge for developers and designers. We’ll talk about what CiviCRM does, how to approach using it (plan, plan, plan), and some pitfalls along the path to integration.

[CiviCon 2010](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007034450/http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRM/CiviCon%2BApril%2B2010&sa=D&ust=1543339874072000)

### CiviCRM: The Benefactress and the Diva

CiviCRM is an open source, web-based, constituent relationship management application. Predominantly used by advocacy and non-profit groups, Civi can track contact data, enable memberships and donations, organize constituent groups, manage events, and make communication more effective. Although there is a standalone version, Civi is more commonly integrated into a Drupal or Joomla CMS installation. This is not an “upload and install” application, most clients will need the help of a developer (and designer) to get good results from this feature-rich tool. This month, I’ll present some of Civi’s benefits and offer suggestions for the care and feeding of it’s sometimes quirky and complicated diva aspects.

## Feedback
I found Diana Montalion’s keynote particularly fascinating.

The second session, “Drupal for Non-Geeks” was fantastic for me. It helped me link my old undergraduate learning about programming and databases to the current language of Drupal. Now I have a better understanding of how the framework works and can request changes to my Community Weaver 2.0 website from a more informed point of view.

Diana is an excellent presenter, and very knowledgeable about the common gaps people have in their understanding of Drupal.

Loved your classes last night and this morning at Drupal Camp at Stanford. I found your class on Mad Skillz very helpful. I’m a writer/editor and a hell of an organizer. I didn’t even know IA existed. Now I know its a niche I’d like to explore.

She’s a great teacher and very knowledgeable.

Diana is an EXCELLENT person & teacher. My lack of practice: the only reason my coding skills != her teaching skills.

I sat in this session out of curiosity and want to commend Diana on what i think was a fantastic and totally approachable beginning php session. The examples she gave made ALL the difference.

The best session at this DrupalCon so far. Very entertaining, really nice, a fantastic speaker, which knows her stuff. Very sympathetic, too. It made my Wednesday!
