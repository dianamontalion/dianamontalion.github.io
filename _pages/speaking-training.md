title: Speaking and Training
subtitle: A fun part of tech life
description: Diana Montalion talks and trainings on strategic thinking, systems architecture, solution architecture, content systems, and content management systems.
excerpt: As part of my tech life, I enjoy speaking, writing and developing learning experiences. (After all, I was an actor and trainer before I learned to code.) I especially like making complex issues contextually relatable for people new to the subject.

As part of my tech life, I enjoy speaking, writing and developing learning experiences. (After all, I was an actor and trainer before I learned to code.) I especially like making complex issues contextually relatable for people new to the subject.

My current focus is [strategic thinking and enterprise system architecture](https://architecting-enterprise.com), but speaking remains my first love. Here are some past examples:

## Training
I have developed sold-out training programs with three different organizations and was Global Chair for DrupalCon training. While I don't train anymore, I'm happy to discuss developing both curriculum and trainers.

### Drupal 8 for Drupalistas

The first training offered to teach developers the newest version of Drupal.

* Summary (original page is offline) for [DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015](https://www.amazeelabs.com/en/drupalcon-los-angeles-day-1-dawn-drupalistas)
* [DrupalCon Austin 2014](https://austin2014.drupal.org/training/drupal-8-drupalistas.html)
* [DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014](https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/training/drupal-8-drupalistas.html)

### Online: PHP Course

In partnership with OSTraining, an entire Introduction to PHP programming course from variables to storing data in the database.

* [Course overview (subscription required)](https://www.ostraining.com/class/php/)

### PHP for NonProgrammers

This is a friendly programming introduction for people new to coding. The course takes a “Physics for Poets” approach to basic PHP concepts like variables, if/else statements, Boolean logic, functions, and hooks. Participants write code, read code, and have a clear understanding of how to continue practicing.

* [DrupalCamp Austin](http://2011.drupalcampaustin.org/training/php-non-programmers)

### Responsive First: Design and Build a Site for All Devices

I was the training program developer and teaching team member, not a subject matter expert. This class was the first offered at a Conference on "how to make a theme work on all devices".

## Talks
Many of my talks were given in the Drupal ecosphere because enterprise Drupal and open-source communities were my focus. Nowadays, I focus on enterprise system architecture, integrating multiple technologies, and strategic thinking. I remain grateful to the community that nourished my ideas as I grew them.

### Decoupling *The Economist*

*The Economist* is currently served digitally by Drupal 6. Yes, yes, Drupal 6. To meet the content data needs of the many Economist products, a decoupled microservices architecture is being designed and built.

The backend is, for the moment, still Drupal 6 with an API added to deliver JSON. The midTier microservices layer uses GoLang. The decoupled, component-based Front End uses Node.js and ReactJS. A side aim of the project is to build a continuous integration environment that will weave the layers together. And a continuous deployment workflow to allow quick changes. This talk will give a high-level view of the project.

* [Drupal NYC 10.15](https://youtu.be/lwBFukxBZS4?t=2321)

### Keynote: Collaboration in Diverse Teams

Diversity is a hot buzz word in tech these days. But when we think diversity, do we think “anyone in the world could be on this team?” When I began in this industry, my primary diversity challenge was being the only female backend dev. Now, having worked with multinational teams, I know that the potential diversity challenges are infinite.

How do we create strong teams, and a strong community, when the members are more different than alike? When solving complex problems, difference is our greatest asset. Different points of view and experiential expertise is essential. Understanding and embracing these differences is so difficult, we often maintain walls where we need bridges. How do we build the most well-engineered bridges possible, while still enjoying the work? Diverse teams call into question some of our deepest values. And as a result, yield the deepest rewards.

### Solution Architecture: Designing a strategy for project success

When a project is born, the battle for power and control begins. Power and control, by themselves, are poor strategy. Control is linear thinking laid over the big ball of wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey interconnections in reality where the best laid plans often go awry.

Strategy is real power -- the power to chose, limit, and prioritize while allowing for collaborative creativity and shared vision. Yes, strategy defines what needs planning. But the goal of the work is to shine a light down the path through complexity while honoring, even savoring, the complexity itself.

Strategy is hard to do well. The rules are easy. When applied to software development, strategy is an engineering process sometimes called solution architecture. We'll explore the four elements of good strategy.

### Drupal as a Data Purveyor

For DataDay Texas, a two-part talk on layering Drupal with emerging technologies to create a performant, scalable data purveyor that meets the needs of "big data".

* [Slides for Part 1](https://www.slideshare.net/praxent/drupal-as-a-data-purveyor)
* [Slides for Part 2](https://www.slideshare.net/praxent/drupal-as-a-data-purveyor-part-ii)

### PHP for NonProgrammers

This is a friendly programming introduction for people new to coding. We’ll take a “Physics for Poets” approach to basic PHP concepts like variables, if/else statements, and functions. You’ll write some code, speak some geek, and start down the addictive path of programming logic. There’s also a geek quiz – in case you don’t know your Picards from your Kirks.

This has been offered multiple times. A few examples:

* [DrupalCon San Francisco](http://sf2010.drupal.org/conference/sessions/php-nonprogrammers.html)
* [Notes and videos from DrupalCamp Austin](http://dogstar.org/drupal/content/php-non-programmers-drupalcamp-austin)
* Southwest Drupal Summit (site now offline)

### Mad Skillz: Become the Best in the World

Are you a themer or developer who wants to work on bigger, more complicated projects? Do you want to send your resume to top Drupal shops and get hired? Do you want to assess and approve your skills? You will leave with you a take-home list of essential traitz and skillz. You’ll also find out what a few top Drupal shops and in-house Drupal team leaders say are the “Most Important Skillz” their best developers possess.

* [DrupalCon London](http://london2011.drupal.org/conference/sessions/mad-skillz-become-best-world)

### Building a Dynamic Team

In this Do it with Drupal presentation, Diana looks at building a great team. A website is as effective, performant, and reliable as the team who builds it. Whether you need one developer or twenty, finding the right people is essential to a site’s success. What are the traits and skills to look for when hiring a Drupal developer? What can we learn from Drupal shops with years of experience building successful, and sometimes unsuccessful, Drupal development teams?

Once you find the right people, successful projects require a creative, ongoing blending of talent into a focused, productive team who, like a flock of birds, can adapt to course changes with grace. How can you encourage technical team leads to work with project managers, business owners, and stakeholders in ways that encourage and support the team’s dynamic problem-solving process? How do you turn expertise into successful Drupal products?

* [Drupalize.me](http://drupalize.me/videos/building-dynamic-team)

### Drupal for NonGeeks

If you will never write a line of PHP code but need to understand how Drupal works, this session is for you. We’ll focus on a high-level, conceptual understanding of the Drupal framework. The goal of this session is to enable nonGeeks to make decisions about applying Drupal to their real world challenges and talk to developers (in their language).

* [DrupalCamp Stanford](http://drupalcamp.stanford.edu/sessions/drupal-nongeeks)

### Big Websites

Drupal powers many small-to-medium websites, from personal blogs to company intranets. Drupal also powers big sites like *The Economist* and The White House. How are the big sites different from the small ones? What are the main issues to consider when adopting Drupal for the enterprise? What skillset do developers need to build them?

* This session has been offered multiple times. Here’s [a video from Southwest Drupal Summit](http://vimeo.com/20182312). Note: I had a broken foot.

### Teaching Drupal

You know how to use Drupal. You know how to write code, build a theme, and SEO a site. But do you know how to teach others to use Drupal? For every site we create there are clients who must use it, many don’t know a node from a block. After this session, you will be able to introduce clients to Drupal without freaking them out.

* This has been offered multiple times. Here’s the first and my favorite: [DrupalCon Cophenhagen](http://cph2010.drupal.org/sessions/teaching-drupal.html).

### Intro to Drush

When I was introduced to drush, a command line shell and scripting interface for Drupal, I thought, “meh, I can do those tasks already in about the same time with no learning curve.” Now? “Omg omg, do you use drush? You gotta try drush! It’s awesome!” Find out why drush has transformed me into a groupie. In this session, we’ll walk through installing a Drupal site using drush, enabling modules, and common tasks like running update hooks, cron, and clearing the cache.

* [Video from DrupalCamp Austin 2010](https://vimeo.com/17682905)

### The Economist (Tech Talk)

The Economist.com website is powered by Drupal and is currently being developed by three collocated teams – London, New York, and Austin.

In this presentation, the Economist dev team will describe the innovative solutions, daily workflow, performance challenges, necessary customizations, testing scheme, and third-party vendor integration that delivers The Economist Online to millions of users.

* [DrupalCon London](https://drupal.tv/external-video/2013-03-23/drupalcon-london-2011-economist-informal-technical-case-study)

### CiviCon 2010

**Wikimedia Foundation (Tech Talk)**

After online contributions to the Wikimedia Foundation have been processed, $7.5 million during the last fundraiser alone, contact and contribution data is passed to CiviCRM. It is the “fundraiser backend” for managing hundreds of thousands of contributor records and includes some interesting customizations. Diana will talk about how it works, the ongoing challenges, and prove that if Wikimedia can do it, so can you.

**CiviCRM for Drupal**

CiviCRM is an open source, web-based, constituent relationship management application. Predominantly used by advocacy and non-profit groups, Civi can track contact data, enable memberships and donations, organize constituent groups, manage events, and make communication more effective.

Although there is a standalone version, Civi is more commonly integrated into a Drupal (or Joomla) CMS installation. Like Drupal itself, it can be an empowering tool for groups with a mission. It can also be a challenge for developers and designers. We’ll talk about what CiviCRM does, how to approach using it (plan, plan, plan), and some pitfalls along the path to integration.

## Feedback

* *I found Diana Montalion’s keynote particularly fascinating.*
* *The second session, “Drupal for Non-Geeks” was fantastic for me. It helped me link my old undergraduate learning about programming and databases to the current language of Drupal. Now I have a better understanding of how the framework works and can request changes to my Community Weaver 2.0 website from a more informed point of view.*
* *Diana is an excellent presenter, and very knowledgeable about the common gaps people have in their understanding of Drupal.*
* *Loved your classes last night and this morning at Drupal Camp at Stanford. I found your class on Mad Skillz very helpful. I’m a writer/editor and a hell of an organizer. I didn’t even know IA existed. Now I know its a niche I’d like to explore.*
* *She’s a great teacher and very knowledgeable.*
* *Diana is an EXCELLENT person & teacher. My lack of practice: the only reason my coding skills != her teaching skills.*
* *I sat in this session out of curiosity and want to commend Diana on what I think was a fantastic and totally approachable beginning php session. The examples she gave made ALL the difference.*
* *The best session at this DrupalCon so far. Very entertaining, really nice, a fantastic speaker, which knows her stuff. Very sympathetic, too. It made my Wednesday!*

Note: There were also a few "you are wrong and here's why" as well as a strange note with <3s in it.
